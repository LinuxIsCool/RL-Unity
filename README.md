## Implementation of STOA Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) algorithms in the Unity Engine.

### Algorithms:
<ol>
<li>Value Based Method - Deep Q Network (DQN)</li>
<li>Policy Based Method - Deep Deterministic Policy Gradient (DDPG)</li>
<li>Multi Agent Reinforcement Learning using MADDPG</li>
</ol>


## Outputs:
## Value Based Method - DQN

<p>In this Unity environment, the goal of the agent is to pick up yellow bananas while avoiding blue bananas.</p>

## Policy Based Method - DDPG
<p>In this Unity environment, the goal of the agent is to move the double-jointed arm to the target location indicated by the torquoise sphere. This <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZVIxt2rt1_4">video</a> demonstrates a more practical approach of the Reacher Unity environment.</p>
