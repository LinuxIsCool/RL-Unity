## Implementation of STOA Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) algorithms in the Unity Engine.

### Algorithms:
<ol>
<li>Value Based Method - Deep Q Network (DQN)</li>
<li>Policy Based Method - Deep Deterministic Policy Gradient (DDPG)</li>
<li>Multi Agent Reinforcement Learning using MADDPG</li>
</ol>


## Outputs:
## Value Based Method - DQN

<p>In this Unity environment, the goal of the agent is to pick up yellow bananas while avoiding blue bananas.</p>

## Policy Based Method - DDPG
<p>In this Unity environment, the goal of the agent is to move the double-jointed arm to the target location indicated by the torquoise sphere. This <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZVIxt2rt1_4">video</a> demonstrates a more practical approach of the Reacher Unity environment.</p>

<p>Multi-Agent RL - MADDPG</p>

<p>In this Unity environment, the goal of the agent is to maximize the rally between the two tennis agents, i.e. as the two agents pass the ball to each other without dropping, the higher the reward.</p>
